title: 有点儿 vs. 一点儿
---

Both 有点儿 and 一点儿 express “a little” in some manner. But there are key
differences!

# 有点儿

Used to complain/express negative feelings about something. It is **not** so
much used as a direct quantifier (see examples).

Usually put **before** the adjective. However, when used with _喜欢_ or _想_, it
is put after.

<div class="example-box">
   <h3>Examples</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>我有点儿累</li>
      <li>我喜欢他有点儿</li>
   <ol>
</div>

# 一点儿

While there are many contexts in which you might use 一点儿, it is generally
_more passive_ than 有点儿 and thus **does not** have a negative connotation.
Also, it resembles the English translation of “few” a bit better.

Here are the main uses:

- A little bit of some noun (ex. 1)
- Orders/instructions (ex. 2)
- After a 比 comparison (ex. 3)
- To express “not even a little bit” (ex. 4)

<div class="example-box">
   <h3>Examples</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>我有一点儿行李</li>
      <li>快一点儿!</li>
      <li>我比你高一点儿</li>
      <li>他没有水一点儿</li>
   <ol>
</div>

Notice that 一点儿 **always** goes either after the adjective or before the
noun!
