# Potential Complements

得 (de) / 不 (bù) are placed between verb and resultative/directional complement
to show if the result can be realized or not

Example:

- 看得懂：I can understand the characters I'm seeing
- 听得懂：understand through listening
- 做完：to finish doing something
- 做完作业：finish doing homework

  - breaking up verb and object with potential result complements

- 想起来：remember

- 看不懂这个汉字了：I can't understand the characters I'm seeing
- 看得懂这个汉字了：I can understand the characters I'm seeing
- 做不完：I am not able to finish

* Potential complements usually appear in negative sentences

Examples from last year:

- 他把我的冰淇淋吃了：she ate my ice cream
- 我把书看完了：I read and finished off the book
- 我把花送给她了：I sent flowers to her

得 → can complete something 不 → cannot complete something (not just if it was
done, if it can be done)
