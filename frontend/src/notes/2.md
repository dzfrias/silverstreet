title: 过 vs. 了
---

# Using 过

There are many scenarios in which you would use 过. In all cases, though, it 
goes **after the verb**.

{% box %}
To indicate the action was done or experienced in the past:

- S + V + 过 + (O)

Example: 我去过中国
{% endbox %}

{% box %}
To indicate the action **wasn't** done before:

- S + 没(有) + V + 过 + (O)

Example: 我没去过中国
{% endbox %}

{% box %}
To ask: have you done this (action) before:

- S + V + 过 + (O) + 吗？

Example: 你见过他吗？
{% endbox %}

{% box %}
To ask: have you done this (action) before or not:

- S + V + 过 + (O) + 没(有)？

Example: 你吃过饺子没有？
{% endbox %}

# 过 vs 了

V + 过 expresses an experience that happened _a long time ago_, far from the
present speaking time (我去过中国)

V + 了 indicates an action that finished _more recently_, close to the present
speaking time (我刚才吃了晚饭)

## Negative form

There is an important difference when negating the two:

- Verb + 过: for negative form, keep 过 (我没去过中国)
- Verb + 了: for negative form, **remove** 了 (我没吃晚饭)
