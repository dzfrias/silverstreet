title: Giving Directions
---

To **give directions** from a certain location, follow this pattern:

# Starting

_从 (location) 往 (东/南/西/北) 走_

This tells the person to start from "location" and go towards some cardinal
direction.

# Turns

For telling them when to turn, there are two options:

1. _走 (number) 个 (红绿灯/路口) 往 (左/右) 拐_
2. _到 (road name) 路往 (左/右) 拐_

The first option will indicate where to turn by the number of lights or
intersections passed. The second will indicate where to turn by the road name.

左/右 indicate left/right.

## Extra stuff

When giving **more** directions, you can add 再 or 然后 to make your sentences
flow a little bit better. You can also use 最后 for the last step.

# Ending

To end, you can say:

_就到了。在你的 (direction) 边。_

# Example

从这儿，往东走。走三个红绿灯往左拐。然后，到红白路往右拐。最后走一个路口往左拐。就到了。它在你的左边！
