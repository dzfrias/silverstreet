# Use of 再 and 又

Use 再 to say next time/continuing after something (again, hasn't happened) ex:
你只吃了一点儿饭再吃一点儿吧。

Use 又 to say again as well ... did it again (already happened) ex: 你前天迟到，
昨天迟到，今天怎么又迟到了？

- Since 又 verb is used for actions that already happened, you will usually add
  了 at the end after verb.

Verb goes after 再 and 又
