# the passive 被

the passive voice
Instead of typical subject-verb-object:
Object + 被 + subject + verb

examples:
* 蛋糕被弟弟吃完了
  The cake was eaten by my little brother
* 我的照相机被谁拿走了
  My camera was taken by someone

the passive voice can also work with 让:
→ Object + 让 + subject + verb

examples:
* 蛋糕让弟弟吃完了
  The cake was eaten by my little brother

让 can mean "make somebody", but can also mean by, similar to 被
you can omit the subject if you don't know who did the (usually bad) thing to you
* 蛋糕让吃完了：my cake was eaten (but I don't know who did it)

the passive voice can also work with 叫:
→ Object + 叫 + subject + verb

example:
* 考试叫我考砸

how to negate:
put modifier in front of 被/让/叫
* 问题还没有被解决：the problem hasn't been solved yet
