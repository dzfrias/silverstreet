# 到 place 去 verb - object

Ex:
我到电脑中心去上网：I went to the computer center to go online

3 ways to ask where you're going:
1. 你要到哪儿(去)？ → where are you physically going
2. 你要去什么地方？ → what place are you going to?
3. 你要上哪儿去？ → informal way to ask where you're going

人 + 到 + 地方(place) + 去 + 活动(activity) → emphasizes the place; whereas 去 place + verb-object emphasizes the verb

→ 我到运动场去打球 → I went to the sports field to play ball

* Can't switch 到 and 去
