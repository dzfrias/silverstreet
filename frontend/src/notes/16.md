# TIMES OF ACTIONS

- 次 (ci) = measure word for number of times (often used for # of times an
  action has been performed)
- "number" + 次 combination follows the verb → 一次，两次，三次，好几次，很多
  次，几次

EX:

- 上午我打了两次电话 : I made 2 phone calls in the morning
- 昨天我吃了三次药 : yesterday I took medicine three times
- 我昨天玩了很多次游戏 : yesterday I played games many times

asking a question:

- 上个月你吃了几次中国菜？: how many times did you eat Chinese food last month

notes:

1. If the object of the sentence is not a person/place, 次 should go between the
   verb and the object
2. If the object does represent a person/place, 次 can go either between
   verb/object or after the object 去年我去了西安两次 or 去年我去了两次西安
   (place) (place)

2b. however, if the object is a personal pronoun (我, 你, 他, 她) then 次 must
follow the object我昨天找了他两次，他都不在
